This is code which I developed during my final thesis.

main part of the code is to detect with an rgb sensor, comming parts which are transported over a convejor system.
Every time a neve part is detected the a stepper is moved to catch the comming parts in a box.

There is also a test programm to test the stepper motor. For this test programm you need a two click switches which you need to put at the start and the end of the stepper motor. Every time one of those switches is touched, the motor will change the direction.
